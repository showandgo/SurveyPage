  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    Heʻeia today is one of the most intact and functioning ahupuaʻa systems across Hawaiʻi, even as parts of Oʻahu have overwhelmingly become developed.
    <b>The bioculturally restored lands today honors the traditions of Hawaiian cultural practices, and provides much physical, relational and spiritual nourishment</b>. 
    Many hold deep familial and relational connections to this land, which will be lost if developed. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There have always been pressures to develop Heʻeia lands for commercial profit, and many hands have contributed tirelessly and 
    invested tremendously over the past 25 years to protect and expand 
    its biocultural restoration lands. The aim is to restore Heʻeia ahupuaʻa to a state of ʻāina momona (abundant land) again, 
    back to a land that nourishes and feeds 
    in more ways than one, back to a land that will serve the community and all future generations to come. 
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    Scroll down to explore media to get to know Heʻeia. Your input in the survey below will greatly help us assess the 
    necessary sacrifices and resources, as we plan for Heʻeia ahupuaʻa future.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    
    This 1928 airphoto of Heʻeia shows approximately 90 acres of flooded agriculture fields. This is the restoration objective of many community members 
    in Heʻeia. Today, we are approximately 40 acres short. Limiting factors include financing, labor, exisiting developments, invasion 
    by non-native species, and lack of freshwater.
